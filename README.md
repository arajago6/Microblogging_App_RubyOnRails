#MBlo - A microblogging app built using Ruby on Rails

MBlo came into existence in the latter part of 2015 when I wanted to put my Ruby on Rails (hereafter referred to as RoR) knowledge into action. The functionality of MBlo is similar to that of Twitter where users can share small posts with images and follow/unfollow fellow users. Learning RoR was real fun and I must admit that RoR truly lived upto its tagline of "web development that doesn't hurt". MBlo was built with rich, comprehensive features (for a pastime project) and thus I had already gained significant exposure to RoR by the time MBlo went live. I am very happy with my RoR experience till date and would recommend RoR to you guys as well. Lastly, I would like to sincerely thank Michael for his RoR tutorial!

The source files for this app are originally maintained in a Bitbucket hosted repo. Some files may be have been removed from this public repo to ensure safety of the live app.

Live app is at [mblo.herokuapp.com](http://mblo.herokuapp.com)  and more details about the project are at [mblo.herokuapp.com/about](http://mblo.herokuapp.com/about)
